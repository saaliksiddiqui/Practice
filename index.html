  <h2>ABOUT UNCLE JOHN's</h2>
  <br></br>
  <p>The Papa John's restaurant was founded in 1984 when "Papa" John Schnatter installed an oven inside a broom closet
    in the back of his father's tavern, Mick's Lounge, in Jeffersonville, Indiana.[8] He then sold his 1971 Camaro Z28
    to purchase US$1,600 worth of used pizza equipment and began selling pizzas to the tavern's customers out of the
    converted closet.[9] His pizzas proved sufficiently popular that a year later he moved into an adjoining space.
    Dipping sauce specifically for pizza was invented by Papa John's Pizza that same year, and has since become popular
    when eating pizza, especially the crust.[10] The company went public in 1993. A year later it had 500 stores, and by
    1997 it had opened 1,500 stores.[11] In 2009, Schnatter bought the Camaro back after offering a reward of $250,000
    for the car.[12]
